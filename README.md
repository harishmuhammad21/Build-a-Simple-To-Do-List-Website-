# 📝 To-Do List App

This is a simple **To-Do List** web application made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It helps you keep track of tasks – you can add new ones, mark them as done, and delete them when finished.  
The best part: your tasks are saved in the browser (localStorage), so they don’t disappear after refreshing.
